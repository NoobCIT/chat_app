      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1><br />
      <p>
        Ever work at a workplace where there are just so many engineers and different teams that cross collaboration between them become difficult?  Or think back when you were that new intern with all these questions, but was not sure who to ask?  It doesn't stop there, we've all been in that situation where you've got a question, but the answer seems like something you should already know - so you hesitate.  Or maybe you're stuck in that 'loop' of "go ask this person" and that person tells you to 'go ask that person' and so on...<br /><br />

        Fact is we've all faced this situation at some point or another.  Not only does this hurt productivity and efficiency, but it creates divisions throughout a company, which can harm team collaboration and innovation, project management, and prevent knowledge sharing from one team to the next.<br /><br />

        TeamChat is a messenging application used to, not change your company or work culture, but instead, help unify existing ones and provide more opportunities for collaboration and interaction.  Keep reading to find out what makes our application so special!

      <p>
        Companies split up into multiple subteams generally show a decrease in interaction and collaboration with one another.  It's like having a bunch of small mini companies within one big company.  You lose knowledge transfer from one team to the next.

      <p>
        When companies get bigger, you generally don't get to know everyone.  So when you're stumped with a problem, it's hard to know who to ask... you know someone out there can help you, but who exactly?

        You also tend to cross paths with many personalities throughout the day.  Obviously some personalities are easier to work with than others.  It can be tough to communicate with THAT person directly.

      <p>
        TeamChat is a messaging application with an anonymous feature that can solve these issues.  The application allows you to set an optional screenname to hide your identity, otherwise you are made known in one-on-one conversations.<br /><br />

        The idea is to organize channels in groups that would be helpful.  This would probably be most applicable to large teams such as engineering teams.  A company may have 50 engineers split up into 8 smaller individual teams.  It would be beneficial to have 1 channel with all 50 engineers in one so that questions and problems can pool on the knowledge of the entire team rather than just subteams.  Thus inducing more collaboration and interaction which would increase efficiency and employee satisfaction.<br /><br />

        Interns, new employees, and anyone really would be able to have their problems and questions answered in seconds and team unification would become stronger as a result!
